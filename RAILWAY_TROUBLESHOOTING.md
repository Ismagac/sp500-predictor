# 🚧 Railway CORS/404 Issue - Troubleshooting Log

## 🔍 Problem Analysis

**Issue:** Frontend can't connect to Railway backend
- Backend is running on Railway (✅ logs show server started)
- Model loads successfully (✅ XGBoost model from S3)
- 404 errors and CORS failures when accessing `/api/prediction`

## 🛠️ Solutions Applied

### 1. CORS Configuration Fix
```python
# Before: Limited origins
allowed_origins = ["https://ismagac.github.io", ...]

# After: Allow all origins on Railway
if os.getenv("RAILWAY_ENVIRONMENT") or not os.getenv("DEBUG", "false").lower() == "true":
    allowed_origins = ["*"]
```

### 2. Request Logging Middleware
```python
@app.middleware("http")
async def log_requests(request: Request, call_next):
    logger.info(f"🔍 Incoming request: {request.method} {request.url}")
    logger.info(f"🔍 Headers: {dict(request.headers)}")
    # ... process request
```

### 3. Enhanced Server Start Script
```python
# start_server.py with detailed logging
port = int(os.getenv("PORT", 8000))
print(f"🚀 Starting SP500 Prediction API server")
print(f"📡 Host: {host}")
print(f"🔌 Port: {port}")
```

### 4. Railway Configuration
```json
{
  "deploy": {
    "startCommand": "python start_server.py",
    "restartPolicyType": "ON_FAILURE",
    "restartPolicyMaxRetries": 3
  }
}
```

## 🔎 Diagnosis Results

### Current Status
- ✅ Railway deploys successfully
- ✅ Server starts on correct port
- ✅ Model loads from S3
- ✅ Base URL responds (https://sp500-predictor-production.up.railway.app)
- ❌ API endpoints return 404/CORS errors

### Most Likely Causes
1. **Railway routing issue** - Service not configured as web service
2. **Port mapping problem** - Internal port 8000 not exposed publicly
3. **CORS preflight failure** - OPTIONS requests not handled properly

## 🚀 Next Steps

### If logging shows requests arriving:
- CORS issue, will be fixed by allowing all origins

### If logging shows no requests:
- Railway routing issue, need to configure service type

### If still 404:
- Check Railway service configuration
- Verify domain mapping
- Check if service needs to be marked as "web service"

## 🔧 Additional Debugging

### Test URLs
- https://sp500-predictor-production.up.railway.app/ (✅ should work)
- https://sp500-predictor-production.up.railway.app/health (? test)
- https://sp500-predictor-production.up.railway.app/api/market/current (? test)
- https://sp500-predictor-production.up.railway.app/api/prediction (❌ currently fails)

### Expected Logs After Deploy
```
🔍 Incoming request: GET /api/prediction
🔍 Headers: {'origin': 'https://ismagac.github.io', ...}
✅ Response: 200 - 2.543s
```

## 🎯 Final Solution

Once Railway redeploys with the new configuration:
1. Check Railway logs for request logging
2. Test endpoints directly in browser
3. Frontend should connect successfully
4. CORS errors should be resolved

**Status:** Waiting for Railway redeploy with enhanced logging and CORS fixes
